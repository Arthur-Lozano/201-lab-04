        <p>    Hello there!</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li> My name is Ceylin Brooks. I have traveled an interesting path to get to coding. </li>
                <li>I graduted high school and enlisted in the United States Air Force, while I was in the Air Force I gained customer service experience 
                through my time in the Air Force in I rotated through working in Food, Fitness, Morturary and Lodging.</li>
                <li>I attended a couple college classes but none of them piqued my interest! </li>
                <li>I seperated from the Air Force and thought that a career in Occupational Therapy
                would be the way to go but quickly found that it wasn't I wanted to do either.</li>
                <li>I stumbled into coding and fell in love with it. </li>
                <li>I am fascinated by how we are able to build websites and web applications from the ground up.</li>
                <li>One of my main goals in becoming a Software Engineer is wanting to build an app that can eventually be downloaded my family and friends.</li>
                <li>Another major goal that I have is to encourage more women and people who look like me to enter the feild of technolgy.</li>
                <li>I feel that we are underrepresented and I would to aid in increasing the amount of diversiy present in the field of technolgy. </li> 
          </p>
             
            </ul>
