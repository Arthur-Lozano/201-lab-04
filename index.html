        <p>    Hello there!</p>
        <p>
             My name is Ceylin Brooks. I have traveled an interesting path to get to coding. 
             I graduted high school and enlisted in the United States Air Force, while I was in the Air Force I gained customer service experience 
             through my time in the Air Force in I rotated through working in Food, Fitness, Morturary and Lodging.
             I attended a couple college classes but none of them piqued my interest! 
             I seperated from the Air Force and thought that a career in Occupational Therapy
             would be the way to go but quickly found that it wasn't I wanted to do either. I stumbled into coding and fell in love with it. 
             I am fascinated by how we are able to build websites and web applications from the ground up. One of my main goals in becoming a 
             Software Engineer is wanting to build an app that can eventually be downloaded my family and friends. The other major goal that I 
             have to encourage more women and people who look like me to enter the feild of technolgy. I feel that we are underrepresented and I would 
             to aid in increasing the amount of diversiy present in the field of technolgy.     </p>
